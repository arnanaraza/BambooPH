# BambooPH

Overview:
This repository will collate the processing steps for bamboo mapping in the Philippines using the fractional cover method. 

Scripts:
main.R for wrapping sub-scripts of preprocessing Remote Sensing (RS) inputs particularly creating vegetation indices, resampling to 100m, training  and validating a random forest regression model. It will also include a script to visualize the wall-to-wall bamboo cover. 

The Google Earth Engine script for generating pixel-based LULC map: https://code.earthengine.google.com/a05d10d47d21c73d0f546e73974bd8a3

Data:
bamboo inventory data, 30 randomply sampled plots within a bamboo landscape
